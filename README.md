# Palindrome Star Pattern Generator

This repository contains a Python program that generates a diamond-shaped "palindrome" star pattern. The number of rows for the diamond is specified by the user, allowing for flexible and customizable pattern sizes.

## Pattern Examples

Below are examples based on different row inputs:

- **For `rows = 4`:**
  ```
     *
    ***
   *****
  *******
   *****
    ***
     *
  ```

- **For `rows = 5`:**
  ```
      *
     ***
    *****
   *******
  *********
   *******
    *****
     ***
      *
  ```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure Python is installed on your computer to run the program.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/palindrome-star-pattern.git
   cd palindrome-star-pattern
   ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   Use the following command to execute the program:
   ```bash
   python star_pattern.py
   ```

3. **Enter the Number of Rows**:
   When prompted, input the desired number of rows for the pattern. For example:
   ```
   Enter the number of rows for the pattern: 4
   ```

## Usage

After entering the number of rows, the program will generate a centered diamond star pattern based on the input. 

### Example Run

For an input of `4`, the output will be:
```
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
 *****
  ***
   *
```

## Code Features

- **Customizable Pattern Size**: Adjusts the diamond shape based on the user's input.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures the user enters a positive integer for rows.
